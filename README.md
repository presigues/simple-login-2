# simple-login-2

you can test it here : https://66be3ca79a4e0d0eb1aa67cf--euphonious-torrone-94dbe3.netlify.app


this is another simple ui design for a login / signup system, however it is currently not functional with a proper login system

this project is still being worked on however it has a login screen where you can type a username / email an dpasword, and also buttons to sign in with github or google

this website is more of a ui design project, however i hope its cool to check out!
